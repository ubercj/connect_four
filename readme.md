This project was part of the rspec module of The Odin Project. The goal was to practice Test Driven Development to create a game of connect four that can be run in the terminal.

I learned a lot about using rspec with this exercise, but I also feel like this was the first time that Object Oriented Programming really clicked for me. For my first attempt, writing tests in rspec was maddeningly difficult, because I had all of these class functions that did too many things, and I was trying to stub out a ton of methods for each test.

I feel I had a bit of a breakthrough on my second attempt. I made a renewed effort to create the test first, and then write the method. This led to me breaking up my methods into smaller ones that each only do one thing. Not only did this make my code easier to test, but it also ended up being cleaner and easier to read.

Overall, I'm very happy with what I was able to accomplish. The earlier tic-tac-toe project just completely stumped me, and it's encouraging to see how much easier it was for me to make this connect four game.
